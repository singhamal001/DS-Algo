/*PROBLEM STATEMENT
Min and Max

Congratulations on making up to this question. Let us give you a fairly simple array problem to solve. If you know how to iterate through the array, you will easily be able to solve this.
The problem statement is simple- given N

 elements, find the minimum and maximum numbers among those elements.
Input format

The first line contains test case T
 denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines,
First-line contains N representing the length of the array.
The second line contains N

 space-separated integers.
Output format

For each test case on a new line, print minimum and maximum elements separated by space.
Constraints

1<=T<=5

1<=N<107
0<=A[i]<=107

Time limit
